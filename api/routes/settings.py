"""The settings endpoints the eleven-tab screen consumes.

Two scopes, two guards. Installation settings — the mail server, the hostname — are an
**admin** decision: they affect every workspace on the machine. A workspace's own
settings are also admin, but only within that workspace, which `require_admin` already
scopes through the membership row.

**A secret is never returned in full.** Reads come back masked, and a write that sends
the mask back is ignored rather than saved: the settings screen renders `••••3ab1` in
the field, and a user who edits an unrelated tab and presses save must not overwrite
their live credential with four bullets. That is E4's acceptance condition, arriving
here with the store that makes it possible.
