"""Which model this installation answers with, and where that was decided.

§B9.2 puts a user-entered provider key in an encrypted column and the key that encrypts
it in `.env`. This module is the reader that turns those rows back into the thing the
agent understands, and it is on the `api/` side of the boundary because `agent/` may not
import `api/` and the store lives here.

**The store first, the environment second — per value.** That order is the point of P3:
`.env` is what an installer wrote once, the store is what the owner changed from the
settings screen afterwards, and a value set on a screen that lost to a stale environment
variable would be a setting that appears to save and does nothing. Per *value* rather
than per source, so an installation already running on `.env` can move one field at a
time: type a new model name, save, and the key that is already working keeps working.

**Read on every turn, and never cached.** §B9.2's table says a credential entered from
the UI takes effect immediately, and a cache is how that becomes "after the next
restart". The cost is one indexed read per reply, against a model call that is four
orders of magnitude slower.
