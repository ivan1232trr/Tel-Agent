    #     CORS -> request id -> CSRF -> authentication -> trusted host -> route
    #
    # One ordering rule, applied twice: **CORS is outermost, so every response the
    # browser must be able to read passes back out through it.**
    #
    # * The gates below produce refusals (401, 403). A response born outside the CORS
    #   layer carries no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, and a browser reports it as a
    #   network failure rather than a status - so the dashboard could never read the
    #   401 that should send it to the sign-in screen.
    # * `RequestIdMiddleware` catches unhandled exceptions and returns the 500 envelope
    #   *itself*. While it sat outside CORS, that envelope skipped the CORS layer on the
    #   way out, and every 500 reached the browser as `net::ERR_FAILED` with no status
    #   and no request id to quote. The one response class that most needs to be
    #   readable was the one that could not be read.
    #
    # Both were found from a browser. curl does not enforce CORS, so no curl test
    # catches either of them - `tests/test_errors.py` asserts the header instead.
    #
    # The cost of this order: a CORS preflight answered by the CORS layer never reaches
    # `RequestIdMiddleware`, so it is not logged under an id. A preflight carries no
    # application meaning, so that is the right thing to give up.
