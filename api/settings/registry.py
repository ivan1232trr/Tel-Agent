"""What a setting is: its scope, its type, its default, and whether it is a secret.

Declared once, here. A key that is not in this registry cannot be written — an
unknown key is a typo, and a store that accepts typos accumulates settings nobody
reads and defaults nobody notices are still in force.

The declaration also carries the boundary §B9.2 draws. `SMTP_PASSWORD` is a secret and
lives encrypted; `SMTP_HOST` is not. What never appears here is anything from the
*installation* half of that split — `DATABASE_URL`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, the LiveKit keys.
Those stay in `.env` and only there, because a settings screen that could rewrite the
key which decrypts this very table is a screen that can lock an installation out of
its own data.
