"""What the agent says back, and the shape it has to say it in.

**Rule 3 is why this is an iterator.** An agent that composes a whole answer and then
sends it can never be put on a call: the caller hears silence for the length of the
generation and then a paragraph. The fix is not something to retrofit at Milestone 11,
because every interface above it would have been written to a signature that hands back
one finished string. So the signature was an async iterator from the first line, when
what it yielded was a greeting nobody had to generate.

Milestone 0 step 3 is that model call. Nothing above this file changed to get it: the
route already consumed chunks as they arrived, and already stopped when the visitor went
away.

**Cancellation is the same argument.** `cancel()` on a provider is not optional (Rule 3),
and an iterator is cancellable by construction - the consumer stops consuming, the
generator's `finally` runs, and the provider's open response closes, which stops the
generation at the far end rather than only hiding it.

**An installation with no model still answers.** It says so, in words, instead of
failing a request the visitor can do nothing about. That is the greeting below, and it
is the honest state of a fresh install rather than a placeholder left behind.
