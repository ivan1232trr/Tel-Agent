"""A model behind an OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` endpoint.

The one implementation v1 ships (§B3: *implement exactly one of each*). It is written
against the API *shape* rather than one company's service, because that shape is what a
hosted gateway, a self-hosted server and a laptop running a local model all speak —
which is the difference between "swap the provider" being a configuration change and
being a rewrite. `LLM_BASE_URL` is the whole of that swap.

**Every token is yielded from inside the open response.** Collecting the stream and
returning it would satisfy the type and break Rule 3; worse, it would make cancellation
impossible, because there would be nothing left to close when the visitor leaves.

**A tool call is the one thing here that cannot be streamed through.** Its arguments
arrive as JSON in fragments, and half of a JSON object is not a smaller JSON object -
so those fragments are joined and the call is emitted once it is whole. Text is never
held back for it: an answer that mentions taking a message is said while the call to
take it is still being assembled.
