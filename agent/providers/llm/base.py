"""The interface every language model sits behind — §B3.

    LLMProvider → stream(messages, tools) -> token stream + tool calls

One method, and it is a stream. Not a convenience: a provider that returns a finished
string cannot be put on a call, because the caller hears silence for the length of the
generation and then a paragraph (Rule 3). Writing the interface this way means the
second implementation cannot quietly be the blocking kind.

**Two kinds of thing come out of one stream.** Text to say, and calls to make. They are
separate types rather than a string with a marker in it, because the day a model emits
something that looks like a marker mid-sentence is the day a customer is read a
function call out loud.

**`cancel()` is the generator's own `aclose()`.** The specification lists `cancel()` on
the TTS interface, where audio is queued ahead of the listener and has to be thrown
away. A token stream has nothing queued: the consumer stops consuming, Python throws
`GeneratorExit` in at the `yield`, and the implementation's `finally` closes the HTTP
response — which stops the generation at the far end too. That is the whole of
cancellation here, and it is why every implementation must yield from inside a context
manager rather than collecting first.
