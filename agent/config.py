"""What a configured model is, and how the environment describes one.

`agent/` never imports from `api/` (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md rule 3), so it does not share
`api.config.Settings`. That separation is not an inconvenience to work around: at
Milestone 11 the agent is a process joining a room, started by whoever runs the media
path, and it has to be configurable without an API server existing at all.

**Since §B9.2 the environment is no longer the only source.** The key a user types into
the settings screen lives encrypted in the database, and the database is on the far
side of the boundary this package may not cross. So the rule that decides whether a
configuration is *whole* lives here, in `settings_from`, and whoever can read a source
calls it: `llm_settings()` for the environment, `api.llm.resolve` for the store. The
agent never learns which one answered, which is exactly what keeps it free of `api/`.

The environment path is read once, because a value that can change under a running call
is a value that will change under a running call. The store path is read per turn -
§B9.2 says a credential entered from the screen takes effect immediately - and a turn
holds the settings it started with.
