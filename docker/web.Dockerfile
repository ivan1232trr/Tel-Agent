# The dashboard - §B10.
#
# Build context is the repository root, because the UI dictionaries live in
# `locales/`, one level above `web/`, and the build imports them:
#   docker build -f docker/web.Dockerfile .
#
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL is baked at build time - it is a browser-side constant, and
# the CSP's connect-src is derived from it. The default serves an installation
# reached as http://localhost:38471 with the API published on localhost:38472. An
# installation reached under another name rebuilds with its own value; the compose
# file wires that through TEL_AGENT_PUBLIC_API_URL.
